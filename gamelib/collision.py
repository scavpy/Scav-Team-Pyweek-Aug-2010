"""
 Calculate collisions between circles and hexagons in 2D

 All the hexagons have side 2, i.e. they fit neatly in a
 circle of radius 1.

 Assume for simplicity we are only dealing with low-speed
 projectiles, so that if there is a collision at all, the
 moving circle will end up overlapping the hexagon, not
 shooting right past it.

 There is a range of increasingly complex tests:

 0. Does bounding box of circle centred at C, radius r,
    overlap bounding box of hexagon?

 1. Does circle overlap bounding circle of hexagon?

 2. Will the circle collide with a nearby hexagon if it 
    tries to move by velocity vector V, and if so, where 
    will its centre be when it stops against the hexagon?

 3. Like 2, but also, how much "left-over" velocity will it
    have to make an elastic collision, and what will its
    reflection vector be?

 We always start with test 0 and work our way onward as
 far as required.  A failed collision at any stage means
 we can just return False.

 Since all the hexagons are identical, the geometry of the
 hexagon can be stored as a list of corner points, a list of
 side vectors, and a list of side normals.

 All tests are begun by transforming the circle's position
 so the centre of the hexagon is at the origin.
