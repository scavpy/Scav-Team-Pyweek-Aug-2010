   (scav)  branch: screen, status: done


2. On the title page, when I click the "Start" button, the title page
   will be replaced by the game.
   (scav)  branch: screen, status: done

3. After playing the game, I will be returned to the title page.
   (scav) branch: screen, status: done

4. When I start playing the game, I will see a grid of hexagons
   representing the first game level, with the camera centred on a
   representation of the player.
   (scav) branch: hexagons, status: done

5. The movement keys will move the player around on the grid.
   (At this stage, don't bother about collision with walls or staying
   within the bounds of the grid.)
   (scav) branch: movement, status: done

6. The player turns to face the direction of movement.
   (scav) branch: movement, status: done
  
7. The camera remains centred on the player.
   (scav) branch: movement, status: done

8. The player cannot move into one of the occupied hexagons.
   (scav) branch: collision, status: dev

9. Clicking the mouse fires a ball in the direction from the player to
   where the mouse click took place. (At this stage, the ball doesn't
   do anything interesting, and disappears after a certain duration of
   travel.)
   (Pressing ESC quits the game screen)

10. The ball bounces off any occupied hexagons in a semi-realistic way.

11. The ball destroys up to 3 normal coloured hexagons before disappearing.

12. The ball kills the player too. The game screen exits to the score
    screen, which in turn exits to the title screen.

13. The player wins on reaching an exit hexagon. The game screen exits to a
    victory screen, which exits to the title screen.

14. Winning proceeds to the next level, unless there are no more levels,
    then it goes to the victory screen. The level number is shown in the
    top left of the screen.

15. At the start of each level, some narrative text is overlaid on the
    screen, until dismissed by a key press or mouse click. This should
    be white text on alpha < 1 black.

16. The title screen should play the title-page music.
    (Threads) branch: music, status: dev

17. The game screen should play the in-game music.

18. Destroying hexagons should increase the score, which will be shown
    on the bottom right of the screen.

19. Monsters will roam the grid. They move randomly or bounce around like
    the ball.  Contact with the player kills the player. Contact with the
    ball kills the monster.
